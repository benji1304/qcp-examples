/*
 * This is a sample plugin for use in the new JavaScript Quote Calculator. It exports all of the methods that
 * the calculator will look for, and documents their parameters and return types.
 *
 * These methods are all optional. One may export any, all, or none of them in order to achieve the desired behavior.
 *
 * Note that the plugin is an ES6 module. It is transpiled via Babel, and thus it is module-scoped by default. One may
 * use any elements of the ES6 language or syntax. However, the plugin must be able to run in both Browser and Node
 * environments. This means that one cannot expect browser global variables such as window to be available.
