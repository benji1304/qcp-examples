# SFDC QCP Extension
This file was created from the SFDC QCP VSCode extension.


All files will be stored in the `/src` folder and will be saved with a `.ts` extension for better code validation, BUT these files cannot have any typescript types included, as they are not compiled before being sent to Salesforce.

**To utilize the plugin, refer to the following commands:**

## Available Commands
- `SFDC QCP: Validate org credentials are valid`
  - Confirm credentials for org are valid
- `SFDC QCP: Initialize Project`
  - Create all project files as needed
  - Re-enter credentials for org
  - Create example files and pull all
- `SFDC QCP: Create example QCP files in your project`
  - Choose one or more examples files to add to your project (this overwrites any existing files with the same name)
- `SFDC QCP: Pull specific QCP file from SFDC`
  - Refresh a specific file that already exists locally
- `SFDC QCP: Pull all QCP files from Salesforce`
  - Pull all script files from Salesforce (this overwrites existing files with the same name)
- `SFDC QCP: Pull remote file from Salesforce`
  - Pull specific file from remote, even if it does not exist locally (this overwrites existing files with the same name)
- `SFDC QCP: Push file to Salesforce`
  - Choose file to push to Salesforce, which will create or update record on Salesforce
- `SFDC QCP: Push all files to Salesforce`
  - Push all files in project to Salesforce. This will update records that are included in `.qcp/qcp-config.json` (because we know the Id) and will create all other records on Salesforce.
- `SFDC QCP: Backup local or remote files`
  - Local
    - This will copy all files from `/src` to a new folder called `/{date}`
  - Remote
    - This will fetch all files from Salesforce and copy to a new folder called `/{date}`
